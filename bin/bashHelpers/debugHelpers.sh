# Debugging possibilities .. (good to have these turned off when in production, but can be turned on while still building ..)

# To be used when it is hard to find where in the code exactly the error originates from "cannot make dir already existing".
# Will lose the actual error message (the above "cannot make dir") - but instead will print the LINE and FILE where the error came from.

# This sub needs to be brough in to "somewhere" - and it will act on that script and all its children.
# do this by
# . debugHelpers.sh

# (more details and musings below)

# ------------------------------

# In-code error checking can also be done like this :

# set -e
# commandToBeTested
# set +e

# That checks only the command, and stops checking after that.

# ------------------------------

# To locate all instances of anything (here "runB" ) in all the codes (here only the .sh ),
# and printing the script full path and the matching lines :

# for file in $(find /home/molhaem2/telenius/CCseqBasic/CB5aDev/RELEASE -name '*.sh'); do echo $file; cat $file | grep 'runB' | grep -v '^\s*#'; done | grep -B 1 'runB'

# ------------------------------

# The below are taken from :
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64786/error-handling-in-bash

set -o pipefail  # trace ERR through pipes (the first error in pipe is reported. if not set, only last command of pipe is checked for error)
set -o errtrace  # trace ERR through 'time command' and other functions (jelena doesn't know what exactly this does)
set -o errexit   # set -e : exit the script if any statement returns a non-true return value

# set -o nounset   ## set -u : exit the script if you try to use an uninitialised variable
# The above is more trouble than it's worth as everything evaluated within $() block becomes unbound.
# And as bash is pretty good in giving "expecting numeric value" when these enter if comparisons, I don't think I need to worry about this.
# Also my coding practise is pretty solid in this.


# Usage of above and below :

# wherever you put the above, and the below sub err_report()
# you get that script failing in any 1) pipefail - piped commands failing, giving error of the first failed pipe
# 2) i-dont-know-what-exactly 3) at all normal errors
# So it doesn't glide through errors as it normally does.
# The below will report the line and script where it fails.
# But you will lose the actual error "directory kissa wasn't found",
# so the above is good to find stuff you don't know where originates from.
# Also it is a bit stupid as many commands report "fail" when the result goes to zero (like grep -c "whatever" ) or file is empty (even file testers report nonzero if file not found,
# even though that is the whole point of file tester)

# bringing this sub into any script with
# . debugHelpers.sh
# will give the 1) name of the code which failed 2) line number where command or any-point-of-piped-command gave non-zero exit status

# caveat : many of these commands give intentionally non-zero (like grep -c "" when the phrase is not found) - and thus will cry wolf.
